# Axis: Parallel Agent Orchestration

Axis is a high-performance orchestration layer designed to enable **Parallel Agent Workflows**. It provides distributed memory synchronization, an atomic job board, and pessimistic file locking to coordinate multiple autonomous agents (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity) in a shared codebase simultaneously.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Distributed Shared Memory**: Real-time synchronization of state and "thoughts" across disparate agent processes via a Live Notepad.
- **Task Orchestration**: An atomic registry (\`post_job\`, \`claim_next_job\`) to partition complex engineering objectives into manageable tasks.
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Granular, pessimistic file-locking protocols to prevent race conditions during parallel execution.
- **High-Fidelity Context**: Systematically mirrors project structure, goals, and conventions to ensure agent alignment.

## Key Protocols
- **PAO-1 (Parallel Agent Orchestration)**: The primary logic-set for swarm coordination.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Natively exposes tools for context management, orchestration, and billing.
